        "answer": "Generally speaking, you are required to obtain authorization to conduct business in a state if you are “doing business” in the state.

        "question": "How are my filings determined?",
        "answer": "Comply determines your filing obligations based on your registrations and where you are located. If you add a new location, Comply assumes that you are registered (or intend to register) with each agency. If the agency does not apply to your business, you can remove the agency by de-selecting it on the Company/Agencies Section of the website. Once de-selected, the agency filing obligations will not appear in your filing list."

    {
        "question": "What if I open up a new location or hire a remote employee in a new location?",
        "answer": "Your business might have additional obligations if it is physically located in, or if it “does business” in, a state, county, or city jurisdiction. Your business might need to register in the jurisdiction and the jurisdiction may require some combination of registration fees, periodic reporting, and payment of annual taxes. Comply recommends that you consult your legal or accounting advisor about whether or not your company is required to register in a particular jurisdiction. Currently, Comply does not offer registration services but we can refer you to a registered agent for assistance. If you register in a new jurisdiction, you will need to update your registration information in the Company/Agencies Section of the website. Once updated, Comply will track your ongoing filing obligations."

        "question": "How do I report personal property?",
        "answer": "Property tax reporting is complex and requires detailed asset schedules. The reported assets include business property like computers, equipment, office furniture, and supplies. Not surprisingly, most businesses do not keep accurate records of all their asset purchases and disposals. In advance of the deadline, we recommend that you start an inventory of your assets. Consider reviewing Amazon, Apple, and other vendors to identify asset purchases."
    },
    {
